# decode-and-visualize-YOLOv8-predictions
After training your YOLOv8 model and converting it to TensorFlow Lite, many users face the problem of decoding the output tensor to the [bbox coordinates, scores, classes] format.
<br>
<br>
This is a sipmle example how you can decode and visualize YOLOv8 inferences after converting it to TensorFlow Lite 
<br>
<br>
Just run **Visualize_predictions.ipynb** and see how it works.

You can change ```IMG_FOLDER``` and ```MODEL_PATH``` variables to your own.
